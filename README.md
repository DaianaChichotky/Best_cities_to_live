# üåç Project: Best cities to live

üíª I am excited to share my final project for the data analysis bootcamp. 

## Introduction

In an increasingly interconnected world, choosing the best city to live in involves a multifaceted decision-making process. Individuals and families consider various factors such as air quality, water availability, educational success, safety, cleanliness, recreational activities, and infrastructure when determining the most suitable place to settle. This project aims to analyze and compare these factors across different cities to identify which ones offer the highest quality of life.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive data analysis to rank cities based on several key indicators that contribute to the quality of life. These indicators include:
  - **Cost of Living**: The expense of living in the city.
  - **Startups**: The presence or number of startup companies in the city.
  - **Travel Connectivity**: The ease of travel to and from the city, including transportation infrastructure and connectivity.
  - **Business Freedom**: The level of freedom to conduct business activities in the city.
  - **Safety**: The safety and security level in the city.
  - **Healthcare**: The quality and availability of healthcare services in the city.
  - **Education**: The quality and availability of educational institutions and services in the city.
  - **Environmental Quality**: The quality of the environment in the city, including pollution levels and green spaces.
  - **Economy**: The economic strength and stability of the city, including job opportunities and economic growth.
  - **Leisure & Culture**: The availability and quality of leisure and cultural activities in the city.
  - **Tolerance**: The level of tolerance and acceptance of diversity in the city.
  - **Outdoors**: The availability and quality of outdoor activities and natural environments in and around the city.
  - **AQI Value**: The Air Quality Index value, indicating the level of air pollution in the city.

## Data Collection

To achieve these objectives, data will be collected from Kaggle, which is collecting the data from various reputable sources:
- World Air Quality Index (WAQI)
- World Health Organization (WHO)
- Numbeo and UNODC

## The analysis included:

- **Data preprocessing:** Transformation of columns, handling missing values, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Including the visualization of interactive maps using the folium and geopandas libraries.
- **Implementation of machine learning models (regression models)** to predict the prices of the listings.

I developed an interactive application using Streamlit, which allows users to explore and analyze Airbnb rental data in the city of Montreal. This tool provides a detailed view of various aspects such as prices, availability, and property features, among others.

This project allowed me to apply and consolidate my skills in Python, data analysis, and data visualization, as well as learn how to use tools like Streamlit to create interactive web applications.
